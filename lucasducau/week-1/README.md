# Week 1

- Installed Docker in both VMs via the ```install.sh``` script
- Brought up a Wordpress container and a SQL container separately on each VM
- Connected them via the Intenal IP Address
- Allowed ports ```3306``` and ```33060``` on the VM's network settings, required by SQL to work properly
- Both VMs see each other and work as intended
